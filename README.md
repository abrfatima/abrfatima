- Hello world! I'm Fatima from Moroccoâœ¨. I love coding and learning new things about programmingðŸ’—. It's literally my joy and happiness, even when it turns into all bugs and I spend a long time fixing them, I still love how it took me through a journey of making mistakes and learning from them. The process of troubleshooting and problem-solving is where the real growth happens. Every line of code is a story waiting to unfold, and I'm all set to go to unfold each one, no matter how challenging.
